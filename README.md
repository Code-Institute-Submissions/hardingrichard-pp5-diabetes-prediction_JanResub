## Dataset Content
* The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
* The dataset was originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  
* The dataset relates to female subjects based on how many pregnancies they have been through and how various biomarkers correlate to an outcome of being diabetic. From this dataset predictive analytics can be used to assist healthcare professionals in providing a prediction on whether or not a patient has diabetes.
* The dataset consists of 768 rows and 9 feature sets which represent the following predictor variables: Pregnancies (The number of pregnancies had by the patient), Glucose (Plasma glucose concentration), Blood pressure (Diastolic blood pressure measured in mm Hg), Skin Thickness (Tricep skin fold measured in mm), Insulin levels (2-hour serum level measured in mu U/ml), BMI (Body Mass Index measured in weight Kg/height m^2), Diabetes Pedigree Function (Scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history), Age (the age of the subject) and a target variable of Outcome (indicator for whether the patient has diabetes)

## Business Requirements
Diabetes is a growing disease which affects a large portion of the population around the world. Accurate and opportune predictions of diabetes is important due to the complications that it can pose on other life-threatening diseases. A medical center in Phoenix, Arizona is looking to improve their diagnoses of diabetes using the assistance of machine learning and investigating how best to use previous patient data in order to better predict whether or not future patients are likely to have diabetes.

* 1 - The client is interested in discovering how various biomarkers in female patients correlate between those with diabetes and without diabetes. The client expects to better understand this by reviewing data visualizations of the biomarker variables.
* 2 - The client requires a machine learning tool that their healthcare practitioners can use to identify whether a patient has diabetes.
* 3 - The client expects an accuracy score of 75% or higher in predicting the outcome of diabetes.
* 4 - The client expresses that the machine learning tool can be easily accessed via a dashboard with the ability to input patient data to produce a prediction for diagnosis which can be used to better support the patient.


## User Stories
The project for predicting diabetes can be divided into 4 epics which are as follows:
* The collection of the data
* Data visualisation and preparation
* Training and implementing the Machine Learning model
* Creation and deployment of the dashboard for endpoint use

## Hypothesis
The following hypothesis will help guide the direction of data analysis for the above dataset.
* Based off of my understanding of diabetes, High blood sugar levels are likely to be a primary predictor of the outcome of a diabetes diagnosis.
    * Visualisation to be used and correlation study to validate
* I predict that Age will have an affect on the correlation of diabetes
    * Visualisation to be used and correlation study to validate
* I also predict that BMI may hold some weight in the prediction of diabetes
    * Visualisation to be used and correlation study to validate
* Biomarkers such as blood pressure and skin thickness will likely hold a low level of correlation for whether or not a patient has diabetes.
    * Visualisation to be used and correlation study to validate
* Due to the dataset being fairly small in size and splitting the data between train and test, may pose difficulties in achieving a high accuracy score.
    * Experiment with Train/Test split ratios or potential use of other ML models to achieve a better score.


## Rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks
* Business Requirement 1 - Correlation and Visualisation of Data
    * Inspect the data relating to the variables in the diabetes dataset
    * Standardisation of data required to analyse due to 0 values on some variables which hold no worth
    * Make use of a Correlation Study to help understand which variables are linked to the outcome of diabetes
    * Visualisations and the correlation study will be used to support the validation
    * The Correlation Study and Feature Engineering notebooks detail these business requirements.
* Business Requirement 2 - Build a Machine Learning model
    * Split data into two categories, training data and testing data.
    * Be able to make predictions of the likeliness of diabetes
    * Make use of a Support Vector Machine model to classify whether or not a patient is diabetic for use in the medical industry.
    * The Feature Engineering and Modeling Evaluation notebooks cover these business requirements.
* Business Requirement 3 - Accuracy of ML tool
    * Having trained the model, testing data will be used to determine the accuracy score for insight into how well the model is performing.
    * The Modeling Evaluation notebook details this business requirement.
* Business Requirement 4 - Creation of a Dashboard for user input
    * Creation of a user interface where a summarised description of model can be viewed
    * Allow for manual data input for the model to predict diabetes outcome
    * The streamlit app pages cover this business requirement.


## ML Business Case
* A Machine Learning model is required to predict the outcome of a patient having diabetes or not.
* Creation of a Machine Learning Model which satisfies the business requirement of predicting at a score of 0.75 or greater on both the training and test datasets. It will be able to make appropriate predictions on test data and any future data used by the client.
* A Support Vector Machine model will be chosen to achieve the prediction due to it being a classifier model and can therefor classify whether or not a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic.
* If the model is unable to reach an accuracy score of 0.75 then this will be deemed a fail anything greater than this would be a success.
* The output of the model will be defined as whether the patient is given a prediction of diabetic or non-diabetic.
* The dataset used for the training of the model is derived from a publicly available dataset on Kaggle, containing 768 rows and 9 feature sets. The target variable for the trainset is the 'Outcome' variable with 0 meaning non-diabetic and 1 meaning diabetic. As this is publicly available there are no ethical or privacy concerns.
* By creating a Machine Learning model to predict the outcome of patients having diabetes it will improve the efficiency of healthcare workers and the medical industry's ability to diagnose patients allowing resources to be used elsewhere.
* Having a dashboard endpoint will allow for healthcare workers to easily input data to achieve a prediction on patient data.

* The page will display a generated message as a result of pressing the button widget informing the user of the predicted outcome of Diabetic or Non-Diabetic


## Bug Fixes
|**Bug**|**Fix**|
|:----|:----|
|Visualisations wouldn't display when running cells.|Used `%matplotlib inline` to make output appear and be stored within the notebook.|
|ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ipywidgets' when trying to load `pandas_profiling ProfileReport`.|Fix was found on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34364681/no-module-named-ipywidgets-error-when-running-ipyhon-widgets) where it was the case of needing to do a pip install of ipywidgets before running the ProfileReport.|
|AttributeError: ‘numpy.ndarray’ object has no attribute ‘to_csv’ when trying to push test/train .csv file to the repo|Fixed by converting to a pandas dataframe using the following code `pd.DataFrame(x_train).to_csv("outputs/datasets/cleaned/x_train_cleaned.csv", index=False)`|
