## Dataset Content
* The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data). 
The Dataset relates to female subjects based on how many pregnancies they have been through and how various biomarkers correlate to an outcome of being diabetic. From this Dataset a user story was then created where predictive analytics can be used to assist healthcare professionals for providing a prediction.
* The dataset consists of 768 rows and 9 feature sets which represent the following biomarkers: Glucose (Plasma glucose concentration), Blood pressure (Diastolic blood pressure measured in mm Hg), Skin Thickness (Tricep skin fold measured in mm), Insulin levels (2 hour serum level measured in mu U/ml), BMI (Body Mass Index measured in weight Kg/height m^2), Diabetes Pedigree Function (Scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history), Age (the age of the subject) and Outcome (indicator for whether the patient has diabetes)

## Business Requirements
As a good friend, you are requested by your friend, who has received an inheritance from a deceased great-grandfather located in Ames, Iowa, to  help in maximising the sales price for the inherited properties.

Although your friend has an excellent understanding of property prices in her own state and residential area, she fears that basing her estimates for property worth on her current knowledge might lead to inaccurate appraisals. What makes a house desirable and valuable where she comes from might not be the same in Ames, Iowa. She found a public dataset with house prices for Ames, Iowa, and will provide you with that

* 1 - The client is interested in discovering how the house attributes correlate with the sale price. Therefore, the client expects data visualisations of the correlated variables against the sale price to show that.
* 2 - The client is interested in predicting the house sale price from her 4 inherited houses, and any other house in Ames, Iowa.


## Hypothesis & Validation
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 


## Rationale
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks


## ML Business Case
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualised an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course 


## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other items that your dashboard library supports.
* Eventually, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but eventually you needed to use another plot type)



## Bug Fixes
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly in case all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.


## Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
